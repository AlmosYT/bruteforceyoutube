Code sample for brute-forcing a youtube video link

# Information
This is the code snippet I specifically used for one of these "find the rest of youtube link" challanges.

Please note that the challenge I made this for only had two chars missing and they were letters only. This could easily be changed to include "special" chars and numbers too, I am uploading it for someone to modify it if needed.

The useful part is where it determines if video link exists - without using the actual (paid) YouTube API. (Obviously I am reccommending that you use that, but this works too.)

The youtube video had a nitro link in its description.

# Specs

- It took two minutes for the script to find the code with 2 chars missing.
- Making the script took 20 minutes.
- Video was found on January 2nd 2021 at 7:22 PM CET
