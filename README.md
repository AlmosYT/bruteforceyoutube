Code sample for brute-forcing a youtube video link

INFORMATION
This is the code snippet I specifically used for one of these "find the rest of youtube link" challanges. Please note this only works if there are two chars missing and they are letters of the alphabet.
This could easily be changed to include "special" chars and numbers too, I am uploading it for someone to modify it if he wants to.
